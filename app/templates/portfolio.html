                    <h3>foodloggr</h3>
                    <p>Traditional food logging apps require more effort than they really should. You have to search for food items in an enormous database, where official entries are mixed in with user-submitted entries, and a lot of the time those databases are very US-centric. This makes it difficult to track what you are eating, often leading to just giving up on using the service. foodloggr aims to simplify that process – you just enter what you eat, that’s it.</p>
                    <p>foodloggr is built using the Flask framework for Python, and is hosted on Amazon EC2 with user content stored on S3.</p>
                    <p>foodloggr was covered by <a href="http://www.startupnews.com.au">//Startup News</a> in October 2015. You can read the article <a href="http://www.startupnews.com.au/2015/10/06/foodloggr/">here</a>.</p>
